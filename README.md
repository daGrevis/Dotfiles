**Warning**: screenshots above show repo as in [commit 297129a](https://github.com/daGrevis/Dotfiles/tree/297129a).

# Installation

This repo is structured in a way that allows config to be symlinked
by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) in a super simple yet powerful
way.

Any directory you see in root of this repo can be symlinked like this:

~~~
stow --ignore=".md" vim
~~~

If we assume that `vim/` contains `vim/.vimrc`, running the command above will
link from `~/.vimrc` to `$REPO/vim/.vimrc`.

This works for everything so just "stow" what you want and config should be in
correct place. Be aware that some things may have manual setup described in
`README.md` of that thing (ex. `firefox/README.md`).

Examples:

~~~
# Check https://github.com/daGrevis/Dotfiles/tree/master/vim
stow --ignore=".md" vim
# Check https://github.com/daGrevis/Dotfiles/tree/master/zsh
stow --ignore=".md" zsh

stow --delete vim # But don't...
~~~

If you want everything like I do and fast, try `stow_everything.sh`. It's not
a good idea though.
